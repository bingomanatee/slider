# Slider

This is a slider built as a jQury plugin .

Note, this is a web-starter-kit project. The dist folder has the compiled distributable (though its merged with the 
implementation file) but the human-readable version is in app/scripts. 

To serve the demo locally, use these console commands

``` console

npm install
gulp serve

```

the dist/index.html file is also viewable.
